    Select the functions relevant to developer_intent and return the most relevant ones.

    The module/phase plan in proj_dir/fm_agent/phases.json describes the project as a set
    of modules, each with a natural-language description and a list of source_files. This
    narrows the scope to the developer's intent in three passes:

      1. Module selection — opencode (OPENCODE_SETUP_MODEL) reads the module descriptions in
         phases.json and picks the modules relevant to the intent.
      2. File selection — for each relevant module, opencode reads that module's source
         files and picks the files relevant to the intent.
      3. Function selection — the function-localization algorithm from scope.py ranks the
         functions in each chosen file by relevance to the intent (heuristic signal scoring
         with call-graph, class-scope, proximity, and git-history enrichments) and keeps the
         top-ranked functions per file.

    The selected functions are mapped back to their extracted-function files. A chosen file
    that scope.py cannot localize within (e.g. a non-Python source it cannot AST-parse, or a
    parse failure) contributes all of its extracted functions rather than being dropped.

    range, when given, caps the result to the first (most relevant) `range` functions; pass
    None to return all of them.

    Returns the selected extracted-function file paths (relative to the extracted_functions
    dir, matching the convention used elsewhere in this module), ordered by descending
    relevance score and truncated to the first `range` entries. Returns an empty list when
    phases.json has no modules or opencode selects none / fails to produce a result.

    """
    Step 10: re-run the verification stage (reasoner + bug validation) on only the functions
    whose implementation-vs-spec verdict may have drifted because of this modification.

    A function is verified when it satisfies at least one of:
      1) it was changed in the working tree (added or modified), or
      2) its own [SPEC] or [INFO] block was updated in step 9.

    Note on callees: a function whose callee's [SPEC] changed needs re-verification ONLY if
    that change forced its own [INFO] block (the callee contract it reasons against) to be
    updated. Step 9's upward reconciliation already rewrites exactly those callers' [INFO]
    blocks and includes them in updated_spec_files, so condition (2) covers them — a caller
    whose [INFO] did not need to change is left alone and is correctly NOT re-verified.

    Each target is verified by invoking the reasoner (src/reasoner.py, via the per-file
    wrapper verification._verify_single_file, which calls reasoner() and writes the result
    JSON) — not the streaming watcher. The stale verification result of every target is
    removed first so the reasoner re-runs against the current implementation and (possibly
    updated) spec rather than reusing the cached verdict from the previous full run.

    A reasoner MISMATCH is only a candidate bug; each one is then handed to bug validation
    (verification._validate_single_bug, an opencode pass) which confirms or rejects it.

    Returns the sorted list of extracted-function files (paths relative to the
